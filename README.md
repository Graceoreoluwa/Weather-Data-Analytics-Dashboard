# Weather-Data-Analytics-Dashboard

## Executive Summary
This project demonstrates how external API data can be integrated into Power BI to generate real-time insights. By connecting to a weather API, I developed a dashboard that tracks and visualizes weather conditions for five major Nigerian cities. The project highlights my ability to integrate live data sources, perform data modeling, and build interactive visualizations that support decision-making.

## Business Problem
Weather patterns significantly influence business operations, logistics, agriculture, and daily decision-making.
In Nigeria, timely access to accurate weather information can:

- Improve agricultural planning and food security.

- Support logistics and transportation scheduling.

- Enhance event planning and outdoor activities.

- Provide insights for health and safety advisories.

However, many businesses lack centralized, real-time weather dashboards that summarize conditions across multiple cities for quick decision-making.

## Methodology
Data Source: Connected to a weather API to retrieve live weather data for 5 Nigerian cities.

ETL Process:

- Extracted JSON responses from the API.

- Transformed data in Power Query (flattened nested fields, standardized units).

- Loaded data into Power BI.

Modeling & Visualization:

- Built measures and calculated fields (e.g., temperature conversions, averages).

- Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to track key weather metrics.

- Cities Analyzed: Lagos, Ibadan, Abeokuta, Osogbo, Akure.

## Skills
- Data Integration: Connecting APIs to Power BI.

- Data Transformation: Power Query (M language) for cleaning and shaping JSON data.

- Data Modeling: Creating relationships, calculated columns, and DAX measures.

- Visualization: Designing intuitive dashboards with KPIs, cards, line charts, and maps.

- Business Analytics: Translating raw weather data into actionable insights for decision-making.

## Results and Business Requirement
Delivered a centralized dashboard showing real-time weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, cloudiness) for 5 cities.

- Enabled quick comparison of conditions across regions.

- Provided insights that can be applied in:

- Agriculture: Predicting rainfall trends.

- Transportation: Planning deliveries based on weather.

- Public Services: Issuing health or safety alerts.

Business Requirement achieved: Build a weather-monitoring system that is real-time, reliable, and visually clear for decision-makers.

## Next Step
- Expand coverage to all 36 Nigerian states for wider adoption.

- Add forecasting models (using Python + Power BI integration) to predict weather patterns.

- Enhance dashboard interactivity with drilldowns and alerts.

- Automate data refresh schedules in Power BI Service for continuous updates.
